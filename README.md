This project is a C++ application designed to train an agent to master Atari games, with a specific focus on the classic game "Breakout". It leverages reinforcement learning, implementing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to enable the agent to learn and improve its gameplay through trial and error.

Built using Bazel, this project integrates `libtorch` (the C++ frontend for PyTorch) for its neural network components and the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) to interface with the Atari games. This combination provides a high-performance environment for cutting-edge AI research.

While Python-based libraries dominate the open-source RL scene by offering ease of use and a vast ecosystem, `ALE-libtorch-PPO` contributes a high-performance, C++-native alternative. It is designed for developers and researchers who need maximum performance, a clean C++ integration path, and a transparent, focused implementation of a state-of-the-art RL algorithm.
